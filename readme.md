# cea ⚡️

**Create Express App** — a lightweight CLI tool to scaffold a clean, organized Express.js project structure with ease.

> Similar to `create-react-app`, but for Express.js.

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
npm install -g cea
```

Or use directly with `npx`:

```bash
npx cea init my-app
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
cea init <project-name> [options]
```

### Arguments

- `<project-name>` – The name of the Express app you want to create (required).

### Options

- `--folder <path>` – The path where the project will be created. Default: `.` (current directory).
- `-W, --with-folders` – Include a basic folder structure inside `src/` to organize your code better.

---

## 🧪 Example

```bash
cea init my-api -W --folder ./projects
```

📁 Creates the project at `./projects/my-api` with the following folder structure:

```
my-api/
├── src/
│   ├── config/
│   ├── constants/
│   ├── controllers/
│   ├── helpers/
│   ├── interfaces/
│   ├── middlewares/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── routes/
│   ├── services/
│   └── utils/
├── package.json
├── .env
└── ...
```

---

## 🛠 Folder Structure

When using `--with-folders`, the following structure is scaffolded under `src/`:

- `config/` – Configuration files (e.g., DB, environment)
- `constants/` – App-wide constants
- `controllers/` – Request handlers and business logic
- `helpers/` – Utility helper functions
- `interfaces/` – TypeScript interfaces and types
- `middlewares/` – Express middleware functions
- `models/` – Data models and schemas
- `routes/` – Express route definitions
- `services/` – Reusable service logic
- `utils/` – General utility functions

---
